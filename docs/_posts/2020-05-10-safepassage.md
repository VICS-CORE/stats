Safe Passage is our answer to curfew-pass management during COVID times.

These days, curfews and lockdowns have become commonplace. In such a scenario, different privileges are assigned to different people. For instance, police might allow only a few privileged citizens to go out in an emergency or an apartment might allow only one of its members to leave the complex or NHAI might allow only a few trucks to run on the highway. Typically, police or security personnel are deployed for verification of documents and they scan these documents manually. Such physical verification of documents is time consuming, cumbersome, inaccurate, subject to fraud and requires physical contact. These things need to be avoided as much as possible.

Hence we propose a lightweight contactless solution which allows an organisation to firstly authorize and later authenticate and verify whether a user has necessary privileges or not. Users on the other hand would be able to justify their privileges with minimal contact and time.

Here's a teaser:
