Forecasting is a difficult task. Take weather for example. We have seen how accurate the weather department is with rainfall predictions. The patterns return year after year, all the patterns have been studied and models have been made. They have access to satellites and super computers. Still they get it wrong so many times.

Now this pandemic is called Novel because we have never seen something like this. We do not have enough data. We are not professional AI gurus. We are just a bunch of concerned individuals like you. We use our home computers and work at nights. Data science is a new field that did not exist when we went to school. We taught ourselves and are using them in ways not thought of before. We are able to describe the real situation especially about India much closer than what most other experts are able to. We are doing this because the people who are supposed to do this do not have the time to do it and hence we have not seen anything like that accessible to the public. 

The work we have done is difficult. Else many people would have already done it. But we think it is imporant. Just like a map helps you to drive a forecast helps us to plan our lives. This forecast will change on a daily basis just like the weather. We try to update your models and predictions as we get more recent data.

If you like what you see please share this amongst your friends. Covid is here to stay and we want to help you plan your lives better. The print media is corrupt and would not cover a voluntary effort such as ours. We do not have deep pockets to propagate paid news. So we are relying on you and the power of social media to make this research reach the common man. We are not asking you for funds or to do harcore research. Please share this link to as many people as you can. Share if you care.
