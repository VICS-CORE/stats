We're a bunch of volunteers from India, who are analysing covid data to understand more about it and recommend actions that we believe are important. We're using deep learning, neural networks and machine learning to look for insights in covid data. We are an open group consisting loosely knit alumni, faculty and students of NITK, Surathkal who have come together for this cause.

You can find the source code for all our work on [GitHub][vics-gh]{:target="_blank"}.
